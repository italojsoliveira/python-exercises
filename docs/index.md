# Exercises with Solutions in Python

Coding exercises and solutions in Python from my studies and practice. Here I make it publicly open for whoever finds it helpful.

I expect to write more than a thousand exercises with solutions. _This is a work in progress_. The last commit shows the latest updates.

#### Exercise 1

Write a program that reads the user name as an input and outputs a welcome message.

#### Exercise 2

Write a program that reads the user input and outputs the following pieces of information about it:

- Does it have only space?

- Is it a number?

- Is it alphabetic?

- Is it alphanumeric?

- Is it in uppercase?

- Is it in lowercase?

- Is it capitalized?

#### Exercise 3

Write a program that reads the user input number and outputs a message saying its antecedent and successor.

#### Exercise 4

Write a program that reads the user input number and outputs a message saying its double, triple, and square root with at most two decimal digits.

#### Exercise 5

Write a program that receives two student grades and outputs the average grade.

#### Exercise 6

Write a program that receives a distance value in meters and outputs a message saying its corresponding values in km, hm, dam, dm, cm, and mm.

#### Exercise 7

Write a program that receives a number and gives its multiplication table like this:

    ------------
    3 x 1 = 3
    3 x 2 = 6
    3 x 3 = 9
    3 x 4 = 12
    3 x 5 = 15
    3 x 6 = 18
    3 x 7 = 21
    3 x 8 = 24
    3 x 9 = 27
    3 x 10 = 30
    ------------

#### Exercise 8

Write a program that receives an amount in the US dollar from the user and outputs a message saying the respective amount in BRL. Get the currency rate by scraping a website.

#### Exercise 9
